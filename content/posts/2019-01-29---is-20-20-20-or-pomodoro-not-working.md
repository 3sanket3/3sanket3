Not sure why but both the techniques didn't work for me and I was in need of something that can force me to take a break.

So I invented 😉 the following technique that works for me. It might sound funny but it's effective.

1. Drink 2-3* glasses of water 🥛🥛🥛 (or as many as possible)
2. Start coding 💻
3. You will need to pee in about 20-25* min, go and attend to it 🚽
4. Repeat...



Benefits:
- More water is healthier 
- You will need to take a break
- You will need to leave your seat and walk 
- Once done, you will feel relaxed and your mind will be at peace. It will help you with a fresh perspective on your work.

*[EDIT] NOTE: By researching on* @simoroshka *'s comment below, it is found that to urinate up to 10 times a day is okay, not more than that. More information is curated in the comment itself, I highly recommend you also check the same.*

Give it a try! 

And yeah, any idea about what should I name this technique? 😂🤔

Stay Productive, Stay Healthy!
